2. Re-use Risks and Consequences

a) Where you provide financial instruments to us under a title transfer collateral arrangement or if we exercise a right of use in relation to any financial instruments that you have provided to us by way of collateral under a security collateral arrangement containing a right of use, we draw your attention to the following Re-use Risks and Consequences:
i. your rights, including any proprietary rights that you may have had, in those financial instruments will be replaced by an unsecured contractual claim for delivery of equivalent financial instruments subject to the terms of the relevant Collateral Arrangement;
ii. those financial instruments will not be held by us in accordance with client asset rules, and, if they had benefited from any client asset protection rights, those protection rights will not apply (for example, the financial instruments will not be segregated from our assets and will not be held subject to a trust);
iii. in the event of our insolvency or default under the relevant agreement your claim against us for delivery of equivalent financial instruments will not be secured and will be subject to the terms of the relevant Collateral Arrangement and applicable law and, accordingly, you may not receive such equivalent financial instruments or recover the full value of the financial instruments (although your exposure may be reduced to the extent that you have liabilities to us which can be set off or netted against or discharged by reference to our obligation to deliver equivalent financial instruments to you);
